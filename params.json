Check to make sure it's made, or your options might get duplicated.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUse\r\n\r\n    $this->load->model(\"system_options_model\", \"system_options\");\r\n\r\nIn your controller to load the system options model for use.\r\n\r\nIt provides you with 2 functions.\r\n\r\n### get_option( var $name, var $if_none );\r\n\r\nUse the get_option method to retrieve your options. It takes 2 arguments.\r\n\r\nSetting the name argument tells the method which option to look up.\r\n\r\nSetting the if_none argument tells the method what to return if nothing is set already in the system_options table. A default value, so to speak.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n    $site_description = $this->system_options->get_option( \"site_description\", \"A Useful Site!\" );\r\n\r\nRunning this would return the site description if it was set in the database. If there was nothing set already, it would return \"A Useful Site!\"\r\n\r\n### update_option( var $name, var $value );\r\n\r\nUse the update_option method to set your options. It takes 2 arguments.\r\n\r\nSetting the name argument tells the method what option to set.\r\n\r\nSetting the value argument tells the method what to set that option you specified by the name argument.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n    $this->system_options->update_option( \"site_description\", \"A Useful Site!\" );\r\n\r\nRunning this would set the site_description option in the database to \"A Useful Site!\" for later retrieval.\r\n\r\n## Thanks!\r\n\r\nI hope someone besides me finds this useful! Also, by all means please let me know if there's other functionality that would be useful!","name":"Ci-dynamic-config"}
